# Note

Made for beginners like me to learn some very basic things (Made with Love) ðŸ˜Š
Please don't copy paste cuz i made this for learning! Not for copy pasting!

After 1 or 2 months (Actually Can't Remember Tho ðŸ˜…) I realize Copy Pasting can't make a programmer So Don't Copy Paste :) ðŸ˜„

Will Add Some Extra Thing When I Have Time ðŸ˜‡! Currently Busy ðŸ˜ƒ
